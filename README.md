The Cat Shack has been created for my MS4 project with the code institute. The Cat Shack is an e-commerce luxury pet store which utlizies stripe for payments. The website will build upon existing skills within HTML, CSS and Javascript, and utilize new skills learned within Python, Jinja and Django.

### Surface
I have taken on inspiration from gaming websites such as the Oculus website. I feel the simple colour scheme
of black, white and grey makes for a modern and clean look for the website. 


**Colours**

![colour scheme]()

I wanted to make a modern design, utilising a monochrome colour palette with a splash of green natural tones. White space has also been used to provide a sense of calm.

I have used (#ffffff) for my main text to make the typography contrasting and clear to the user against the white background. 
and have used the text-muted class for my text within the footer section to stand out against the dark background. 

**Typography**


**Heading text**

The font Prata  has been used for headings - this font works well as it is bold,and elegant, providing an upmarket feel to the website. 

**Body text**

Lora has been used for the body text, this sans serif font is clearly legible to the user, especially on mobile devices. It also contrasts nicely
against the heading font.


**Imagery**

Unsplash, Pexels and dreamstime have been used for all the photography within the website. I chose modern images that would fit with
the colour palette and provide a modern and luxury feel to the website.
