### Skeleton

#### Database

#### Wireframes

Wireframes have been created using a mobile first approach.
Please [click here](https://github.com/rebeccadev/the_cat_shack/blob/main/readme_documentation/pdf/userstoryloggedinsiteuser.pdf) to view the PDF showing full wireframes for the site.

### Surface
I have taken on inspiration from gaming websites such as the Oculus website. I feel the simple colour scheme
of black, white and grey makes for a modern and clean look for the website. 


**Colours**

![colour scheme](readme_documentation/images/coolorspalette.png)

I wanted to make a modern design, utilising a monochrome colour palette with a splash of green natural tones. White space has also been used to provide a sense of calm.

I have used (#ffffff) for my main text to make the typography contrasting and clear to the user against the white background. 
and have used the text-muted class for my text within the footer section to stand out against the dark background. 

**Typography**


**Heading text**

The font Prata  has been used for headings - this font works well as it is bold,and elegant, providing an upmarket feel to the website. 

**Body text**

Lora has been used for the body text, this sans serif font is clearly legible to the user, especially on mobile devices. It also contrasts nicely
against the heading font.


**Imagery**

Unsplash, Pexels and dreamstime have been used for all the photography within the website. I chose modern images that would fit with
the colour palette and provide a modern and luxury feel to the website.
