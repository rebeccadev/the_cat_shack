These were by fixed by working through each app via the pep8 online website. Some errors remain such as in the migrations files as these are generated by django.

## Bugs

- When initially testing on mobile the product details copy section was cut off. This was solved by making a media query.

- When testing resposiveness on the Samsung S20 the margin appeared alot larger on this device. 

- It became apparent through testing that I hadn't conducted error handling.
  - A 404 and 500 page were then created to resolve this issue.
